Cost function tells us how good a model is performing. There are multiple types of cost function. One of them is the squared error cost function. 

In square root cost function, we take square of the error. We calculate $y^$ (y-cap) for each value of x and subtract it with the corresponsing value of $y$, giving us the error. We then square that error. We do this for all the rows ($i$) in the data set for a certain value of w and b. We then sum up all the error which gives the cost function's value for a certain value of w and b.
