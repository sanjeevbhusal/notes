The raw data is cleaned before passing it to train a model. In this data cleaning process, we use a lot of different techniques depending upon if the data is structured or unstructured. There are multiple machine learning engineer working on a project. All of the engineers might want to keep a track of all the techniques used to transform the raw data into processed data. 

Instead of giving processed data to some other engineer, you should give them raw data and include all the scripts in the notebook that will transform the data. You can also version the data. This will saves time for other enginners as they donot have to run the scripts that transform the data.
