A histogram is a type of graph that represents the distribution of a dataset by dividing it into intervals, or "bins", and counting the number of observations that fall into each bin. The x-axis of the histogram represents the variable being measured, and the y-axis represents the frequency or count of observations falling into each bin.

Histograms are particularly useful for visualizing the shape of a distribution and identifying patterns or outliers in the data. By grouping data into bins, histograms help to smooth out the noise or fluctuations in individual data points and provide a more comprehensive view of the distribution of the data.

Plot histograms refers to creating a histogram for a given dataset. By plotting a histogram, you can see the distribution of the data and how frequently values fall within certain ranges or bins. This can help to reveal important insights about the data and inform further analysis or modeling.


Histograms and bar graphs are both used to represent data visually, but they are used in different contexts and have different characteristics.

A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a set of continuous data. It is used to show the frequency distribution of a set of data over a continuous interval or range of values. In a histogram, the data is divided into a series of intervals or bins, and the height of each bar represents the frequency of the data within that bin. Histograms are typically used to visualize numerical data, such as the ages of a group of people or the heights of a set of buildings.

On the other hand, a bar graph is used to compare discrete data. A bar graph displays data in rectangular bars, where the height or length of each bar represents the magnitude of the data being compared. Bar graphs are typically used to represent categorical data, such as the number of people in different age groups or the sales of different products.

In summary, histograms are used to show the distribution of continuous data, while bar graphs are used to compare discrete data. Histograms use continuous intervals or bins to group data, while bar graphs use separate bars for each category being compared.
