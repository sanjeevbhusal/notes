# Evaluation metrics

For a machine learning project to be succesful, it needs to meet a certain metrics that has to be decided beforehand.

For different problems, the metric which decides success will be different.

For classification problem, We might decide the success using accuracy, precision and recall.

For regression problem, we want to minimize the difference in the model prediction and actual number. So, you might decide success using mean absolute error, mean squared error or root mean squared error.

For recommendation problem, we might want to only recommend top 10 movies even if the model thinks there are 100 movies that match user's intrest. So, you might decide success using Precision at k , where k is 10 in this example.
