Google has a lot of services such as gmail, search engine, maps etc. A lot of this services can be managed via google workspace.

Google workspace is a term for products such as Drive, Gmail, Google Chat etc. If you want to connect your application with any of these Google workspace products, you can do so via Google cloud console.

Google Cloud Console is a centralized location for Google Workspace Products as well as its Cloud offering (similar to AWS).  You can find Google Workspace in Products and Solutions > All Products > Other Google Products. You can pin it so that it appears in the sidebar.

There are 6 main sections/options in the Google Workspace page. They are Overview, APIs, Metrics, Quotas, Credentials and Product Library.

- Overview is a place where you can get a quick overview related to all your services in Google Workspace. You can see which google workspace Apis are enabled for the project you are currently accessing. You can also see the request your project is getting. 

- APIs is a place where you can see all the enabled APIs as well as all the available APIs. You have to first enable a API in order to access it in your application. This means if your project doesnot have Gmail API enabled, it won't be able to access endpoints specific to Gmail. 

- Metrics is a place where you can see all sorts of metrics for your project. You can filter metrics by Specific API such a Gmail Metrics, Drive Metrics etc. You can see metrics such as total requests, errors, response time etc. 

- Quotas is a place where you can adjust the available quota for a service in a single day. APIs for google workspace products are not free. Google gives you generous free quota limit but you might have to buy the quotas if you exceed the free limit.  

- Credentials is a place where you can create, edit and delete credentials to access the APIs for enabled Google Workspace Products. 

- Product Library is a place where you can explore all the available Google Workspace Products in more detail.
