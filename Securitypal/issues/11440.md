When securitypal completes the creation of altitude report, we upload the report to that particular report request from requests table in altitude report section. However, if a report is uploaded mistakenly, we would want to delete that report.

### Functional Requirements

- Let user delete a already uploaded altitude report. This user should be a staff user. 
- Send notification to client that a existing report is deleted.

When we delete a existing report, there might be 2 reasons to do so.
- There is something missing in report. In this case, we would like to delete the report and upload a new one.
- We uploaded the wrong file that needs to deleted. In this case, we would like to delete the file but not upload a new one. 

If we delete a report, we should clarify the reason so our clients are clear if we are about to upload a new one or not. We should do this clarification in notification message.

If we want to upload a replacement: SecurityPal deleted a altitude report (report name) due to inaccuracies or missing information. A corrected version will be uploaded soon.
If we donot want to upload a replacement: SecurityPal deleted a altitude report as it was identified as a duplicate or invalid file. No replacement needed.

### Technical Requirements

- Modify the backend api to support deleting a individual report for a altitude report request 
- Send notification when the report gets deleted with appropriate message. 
- Track who was the person deleting the report and when did they delete it. This means we need to do a soft delete for the report.
- Write Test case for the api
- Modify frontend to support deleting report. 
- Display notification when page gets reload (Don't need to support realtime notification.)
- Also do we need a new permission to delete customer report ? 
- Check constraint for deleted_at and deleted_by to either exist together be null.





```javascript
let a = "hello"
