When securitypal completes Altitude Reports are displayed in a single table. There are no filters to filter the reports by some column. We want to add a filter to filter the report by Status. There are 4 status of a report. Requested, Accepted, Cancelled and Completed.

We can either add a filter in the Status column just like in dashboard or we can show different tables under different tabs. One tab will be for Requested, another for Accepted, another for Rejected, another for Completed and the final one to display everything together (basically what we have right now).

### Functional Requirements

- Add 5 separate tabs in altitude report page. Each tab should display a table of altitude report that has a single status. 
- Each table should support pagination for reports of that particular status. 

### Technical Requirements

- Support filtering reports by status in the api. (Done)
- Write Test case for the api (Done)
- Support pagination in the api.
- Add 5 separate tabs and display reports table under each tab. (Done)


### Technical Details 

- If we use tabs, we will have 5 separate tables. The table will be similar. The only difference will be that they will show reports that is of one particular status. 
- One challenge we can run into is if we add more filters to the table. In that case, if a filter is active under one tab, do we also make it active under another ? (Lets not worry about other filters for now).
