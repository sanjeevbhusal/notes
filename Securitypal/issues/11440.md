When securitypal completes the creation of altitude report, we upload the report to that particular report request from requests table in altitude report section. However, if a report is uploaded mistakenly, we would want to delete that report.

### Functional Requirements

- Let user delete a already uploaded altitude report. This user should be a staff user. 
- Send notification to client that a existing report is deleted.

When we delete a existing report, there might be 2 reasons to do so.
- We uploaded the wrong report / There is something missing in report. In this case, we would like to delete the report and upload a new one.
- We uploaded same report twice or a invalid file that needs to deleted. In this case, we would like to delete the file but not upload a new one. 

If we delete a report, we should clarify the reason so our clients are clear if we are about to upload a new one or not. We should do this clarification in notification message.

If we want to upload a replacement: SecurityPal deleted a altitude report (report name) due to inaccuracies or missing information. A corrected version will be uploaded soon.
If we donot want to upload a replacement: SecurityPal deleted a altitude report as it was identified as a duplicate or invalid file. No replacement needed.

### Technical Requirements

- Modify the backend api to support deleting a individual report for a altitude report request 
- Send notification when the report gets deleted with appropriate message. 
- Write Test case for the api
- Modify frontend to support deleting report. 
- Display notif


### Technical Details 

- If we use tabs, we will have 5 separate tables. The table will be similar. The only difference will be that they will show reports that is of one particular status. 
- One challenge we can run into is if we add more filters to the table. In that case, if a filter is active under one tab, do we also make it active under another ? (Lets not worry about other filters for now).
