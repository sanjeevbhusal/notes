We 
When a user no longer has permission to be a vendor assess editor, we should remove them from owner and collaborators field for all vendor assessments wherever applicable.

If they are not removed, then the UI looks weird. For owner, the selector just displays the userId and not the user object because the userId is not part of the options of the selector. options only contain users that have permission.

For collaborator, the selector doesnot even display the userId. In this picture a user with a ID of 4 is owner and also a collaborator. But since the user doesnot have editor permission, only userId is displayed for owner field and nothing related to Id 4 is displayed in collaborators field.

### Functional Requirements

- Remove a user from owner and collaborator field if the user no longer has permission to be owner or collaborator. 

When does user no longer have permission to be a vendor assess editor ? 

- If a user is removed from a access group that had a rbac of vendor assess editor.
- If a access group's rbac is changed from vendor assess editor to something else.
- If a access group is deleted.


### Different Ways of doing it 

- When getting vendor assessments, for each assessment we get the owner and collaborators and check if they still have permission. If not, remove them from owner or collaborators and then return the assessments. (Unusal way)
- Anytime user is removed from access group / access groups rbac is changed / access group is deleted, we check if the user associated was a owner or collaborator in any of vendor assessments. If yes, we remove that user from owner or collaborator.



### Technical Requirements

- Modify the backend api to support deleting a individual report for a altitude report request 
- Send notification when the report gets deleted with appropriate message. 
- Track who was the person deleting the report and when did they delete it. This means we need to do a soft delete for the report.
- Write Test case for the api
- Modify frontend to support deleting report. 
- Display notification when page gets reload (Don't need to support realtime notification.)
- Also do we need a new permission to delete customer report ? 
- Check constraint for deleted_at and deleted_by to either exist together be null.
