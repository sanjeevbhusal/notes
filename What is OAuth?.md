OAuth is a way by which a third party application can access a user's information stored in some trusted sites like Google, Facebook etc. 

Basically, using OAuth, a user can give permission to a site to access the user's information stored in another site. This user information includes name, email, profile picture etc. It is mainly used for Authorization purposes.

Example: A third party application needs the user to first create an account. The sole purpose of creating a account before accessing the service is to refer the user's data in the future. This third party application can either make their user enter email and password to signup or let them use sites such as Google, Facebook, Github etc to create an account.
Here, Google, Facebook, Github etc are known as OAuth Providers. 

The third party service can still know details such as name, email, profile picture etc of the user since these OAuth Providers will return the user's data. These Providers donot return confidential data such as user's password. 


OAuth is also used in scenarios where you need to let a third pary application perform some actions on your behalf. Example: You need sites like Vercel to access all your repositories from Github for deployment purposes. In such cases, you will share your github repositories information with Vercel.


To summarize, OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard framework that allows third-party applications to access the resources (such as user data) from a user's account on a particular service (such as a social media platform or an online service) without exposing the user's credentials (like username and password) to the third-party application.


Here's how OAuth typically works:

1. **User Initiates Authorization**: The user initiates the process by clicking on a "Sign in with XYZ" button on a third-party application.
    
2. **Redirect to Authorization Server**: The third-party application redirects the user to the authorization server of the service they want to access. This server is responsible for handling the authorization process.
    
3. **User Grants Permission**: The user is presented with a login page or an authorization prompt from the service they are trying to access. They are asked to grant permission to the third-party application.
    
4. **Authorization Code**: If the user grants permission, the authorization server generates an authorization code and sends it back to the third-party application's redirect URL.
    
5. **Access Token Request**: The third-party application uses the authorization code to request an access token from the authorization server. This access token is a short-lived credential that allows the application to access the user's resources on the service.
    
6. **Access Token Granted**: The authorization server validates the authorization code and, if valid, issues an access token to the third-party application.
    
7. **Accessing Resources**: The third-party application can now use the access token to make requests to the service's API on behalf of the user. The service's API will verify the access token and provide the requested resources if the token is valid.
    
8. **Refreshing Access Tokens**: Access tokens are often short-lived for security reasons. If the third-party application needs to access the user's resources beyond the lifetime of the access token, it can use a refresh token (if provided) to request a new access token without requiring the user's interaction.
